# Monge-distance

Code for Monge's optimal transport distance where the densities are images

This is the code for a numerical solution to Monge's formulation of the optimal transport problem in the case 
where the cost function is the L^2 distance. 

Full details of the algorithm are given at https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.0018.
