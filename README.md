# Monge-distance

Matlab code for Monge's optimal transport distance where the densities are images

This is the code for a numerical solution to Monge's formulation of the optimal transport problem in the case 
where the cost function is the L^2 distance. 

Full details of the algorithm are given at https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.0018.

The paper and algorithm were developed for using Monge's optimal transport distance on the well-known MNIST data set to
show its potential benfefits on certain datasets. In particular, this will be useful for applications in comparing images and 
histograms.
